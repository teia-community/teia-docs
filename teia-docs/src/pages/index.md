# Welcome to the Teia Documentation Site

The Teia [DAO](/teia-docs/docs/governance-on-teia) is a community-powered art platform on the Tezos blockchain.

It started as a fork of **Hic et Nunc (H=N)** and continues its spirit with a focus on decentralization, sustainability, accessibility, and equity.

Teia is an artwork made of artworks — a place where artists and collectors meet as equals. We want to elevate art for all, regardless of fame or following. Everyone should be able to access Teia.

> “Teia is and always will be a work-in-progress, built and improved by its participants.”
