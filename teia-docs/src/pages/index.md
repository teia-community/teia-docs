# Welcome to the [teia.art](https://teia.art) Documentation

The Teia [DAO](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Governance-on-Teia) is a community-powered art platform on the Tezos blockchain.

It started as a fork of [Hic et Nunc (H=N)](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) and continues its spirit with a focus on decentralization, sustainability, accessibility, and equity.

Teia is an artwork made of artworks — a place where artists and collectors meet as equals. We want to elevate art for all, regardless of fame or following. Everyone should be able to access Teia.

> “Teia is and always will be a work-in-progress, built and improved by its participants.”
