Profile information is useful in a number of ways. Most important, it can identify you to your potential collectors
Your profile details are saved with the Subjkt contract. The Profile page is where you update these and it also links to the tzprofiles site so you can add that information.

To edit your profile, make sure you've synced your wallet with teia. Click the menu icon or go to: https://www.teia.art/subjkt

Add a username, description and choose an image for your profile pic. The profile pic may take a few moments to show up. Because it shows with a circular crop, you may have to adjust your initial picture and add it again.

**IMPORTANT** _When configuring your username, please don't use any special characters or spaces. It's also case-sensitive, so we recommend ALL LOWERCASE_

When you click Save Profile, your wallet will open so you can complete a transaction which saves the profile information.

## Tezos Profiles (optional)
[Tezos Profiles](https://tzprofiles.com/) is a 3rd party web application where users can associate their public online identity based on social media profiles and self-attested information to their Tezos address. Tezos Profiles is an extra layer of verification, and it's not required to complete your Teia profile information. It will only add icons confirming you control your Twitter account and wallet address.

**IMPORTANT:** _Tezos Profiles transaction costs 0.3 tez, so avoid doing this now, if you are a fountain receiver (you only have 0.5 tez) or are low on funds.

If Tezos Profiles seems too complicated, you can type your social media handles on your profile description and use your profile link (teia.art/yourusername) on your social media. This is a simple way to validate your identity.



## Creating a Tezos Profile

- To create a Tezos Profile, visit the [Tezos Profiles](https://tzprofiles.com/).
- Connect your wallet (on mainnet). You will now be presented with available verifications that you can add to your Tezos Profile. Currently you can add verifications for twitter, discord and github accounts, for web domain and for an ethereum address. The more the better, but don't worry if you don't have all of these. Even the basic verification is useful and allows you to enter some information - username, description and 'logo' similar to the Teia profile), which will be used by other platforms.

NOTE - don't forget that if you change any of these, you should consider updating your tez profile (and your teia one).

- Click on the 'Verify' link next to the verification you would like to add.

**In order to obtain a Twitter verification:**
- First, enter your Twitter handle. Note: this is just your username alone, like "tezosprofiles."

- Next, you will be prompted in your wallet app to sign a message that links your Twitter handle to your Tezos account.
- After that, you will be prompted to Tweet out that same message, along with a signature to link the Tweet to what you just signed using your wallet. Note: the Tweet must include the entire message, including the signature. Pressing the "Tweet" button will pre-fill the Tweet for you.
- Finally, copy the direct link to the Tweet you just sent out by hitting the "share" button and selecting "Copy Link to Tweet." Use this URL in the final step.

- If the signature in the Tweet matches what you signed with your wallet, the verification should be complete.

**Deploying your Tezos Profile**
- Back on the main list of available verifications, your Twitter verification should now have the "Awaiting Upload" status.
- Obtain any additional verifications you would like to add, and hit the "Deploy Profile" button above in order to start the process of launching your Tezos Profile. Note: if you have already launched a Tezos Profile and are adding additional verifications, this button will say "Upload Claims."

- You will now go through the process of deploying your Tezos Profile which consists of signing operations (no-cost, uploading your credentials) and deploying your Tezos Profiles smart contract.
- After this is complete, your Tezos Profile is now available and can be used by applications and services like Teia!

You can ask for help troubleshooting this process in the verification channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nSGGhxKa).
