If you have just minted some OBJKTs or you have unsold OBJKTs, it's time to Swap them - that means pricing some or all, for collectors to buy.

Note - you can't swap OBJKTs that are already swapped, have already been collected, or if you don't have enough tez to pay the fees. You won't see Swap, Burn, Transfer options or be able to cancel swaps if you haven't synced the account that owns them.

You don't need to swap all of the OBJKTs you own. Many artists like to keep one or two, either as 'artist proofs' or for gifting etc.

Pricing is a tricky area that can be based on how big the edition size is, how well known and liked you are for your artwork, and how well you market it. Another consideration is how much *you* want for the work, not considering collectors and the current market. Pricing consistently and with some thought will influence some collectors.

If you're considering pricing very low (0.01 tez, for example) or free, consider the fact that bots or bottom-dwelling flippers may buy many (sometimes all). When collectors view the OBJKT history, they will see the churn of low price activity that such flippers create, and it can reflect badly on how responsible collectors will view both the work and you as an artist. You can give away manually or try to regulate flipper action by swapping in blocks at different times (this also helps collectors in different time zones).

1. Click on your OBJKT's link to see the details. If you are synced to your wallet, you should see the "Swap" option next to History. (If you donâ€™t see these options, then you have to sync your wallet again.)

2. Click on Swap.

3. Input how many OBJKTs out of your edition that you want to set for sale. For example, if you have `10` and you want to keep `1` and sell `9`, then input `9`. If you want to sell all of them, input `10`.

4. Input how much each edition should cost in Tezos.

5. Click the "swap" button. You will be prompted to approve the transaction in your wallet app.

6. The user interface will update you on the transaction, or you can check in your wallet (look at 'activity' in Temple wallet). Once the transaction approves, your OBJKT/s are for sale to collectors. Go out and tell the Twitter world...
