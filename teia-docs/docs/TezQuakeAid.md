# #TezQuakeAid - Community fundraiser for Earthquake Relief (Turkey/Syria)

## Summary

The recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have caused immense devastation. In an attempt to support relief efforts, the Tezos community has set up donation opportunities to recognised, independent relief organisations.

Artists and collectors can contribute through art sales and promotion of this fundraiser. Direct donations of XTZ are also possible. Read below for how you can contribute.



## Background

The recent series of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have caused significant destruction and displacement. On Monday, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southeastern region of Turkey and the northwestern region of Syria, causing tremors that were felt as far as Lebanon, Israel, Cyprus, Greece, and the Palestinian territories. Just 9 hours later, a second earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, struck the area. 

The death toll has surpassed 10,000, with expectations that this number will continue to rise, and the United Nations predicts it could reach 20,000. So far, over 8,000 individuals have been rescued from the rubble in Turkey, and approximately 380,000 have sought refuge in government shelters or hotels. Others have sought shelter in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques, and community centres. The aftermath of the earthquake, including aftershocks, freezing temperatures, and damaged roads, is hampering rescue efforts and making it difficult to reach those affected.




## Tezos Community Fundraiser

Please note that this is not an official Teia fundraiser. It is organised by a loose collective of Tezos users and built upon grassroots contribution from the whole community.

The Tezos community has taken the initiative to support those affected by this humanitarian disaster. Our goal is to raise funds and make a donation to Non Governmental Organisations (NGO’s) that work on the ground in rescue operations and further relief and support for survivors.

[AHBAP](https://ahbap.org/) is the Organization that has been determined to be the main recipient for the donations, a trusted NGO providing shelter, food, and medical supplies to those in need. 
We are currently looking for further NGO’s that can be added to the relief fund, especially ones that can help Syrian victims, such as those who provide help for Syrian Refugees. Research is currently ongoing for this.

All donations towards the address quakeaid.tez will be collected in a multisig wallet and managed by trusted community members from the tezos ecosystem, who are part of the group that organises this fundraiser. For any transaction to occur via the multisig, a vote needs to take place among these members to determine how exactly to send the money to the agreed-upon NGO’s. If there is no direct way to donate Tezos to the NGO’s, trusted community members will convert the Tezos to fiat and publish all details inc. wire transfer receipts for full transparency.
