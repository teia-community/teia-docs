**Please note** that the data stored on the server is not encrypted and the servers are run by community members.
When setting up a new account, please set a password that you havent used before and keep in mind that direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted
for secure direct messaging better use services like telegram, signal, threema etc.

teias instance (inj contrast to others) is of course friendly towards NFT related posts and while set up first and foremost for our community, open to the wider tezos ecosystem.
