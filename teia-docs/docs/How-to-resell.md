How to sell an OBJKT created by another artist, that you own.

***
If you've collected another artist's objkt then you own the right to resell it. 
This is also referred to as placing your OBJKT on the secondary market. It's much the same as swapping one of your own creations, although a royalty will be paid to the artist.


1. Make sure your wallet is synced.

2. Load your account page on Teia.

3. Click on "collection" and click on the OBJKT you want to resell.

4. Click on the "listings" tab to see all of the owners and sellers.

5. Click on "swap" and set a price for your OBJKT. Remember - if there are royalties, that percentage will go to the artist, so consider that in the pricing.

6. Click on the "swap" button and confirm the transaction in your wallet app.

_IMPORTANT: Once swapping something up for sale, it is held in the Teia escrow wallet while it is "on the market." Therefore, the OBJKT will disappear from your collections. Don't worry; it's still up for sale!_
