1: _(verb)_ to "delete" your OBJKT

Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, so you can't "delete" them. The "burn" button sends the OBJKT to the [burn address](https://tzkt.io/tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX/operations/) - tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX, or you can send it yourself using your wallet app. The burn address is an open address that nobody owns a key to, so objkts are never retrievable.
If you are burning the objkt because you made a mistake and want to remint it, make sure there are no other owners - you can only burn those you own, so you will need to ask those collectors to burn those objkts before you can remint.

To burn an OBJKT:
1. Make sure your wallet app is synced with Teia.

2. Make sure you cancel the swap of the OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it. The user interface will show you how many you have available for burning. Think very hard about how many you'll burn - you can't undo this.

3. Press the burn button. Your wallet app will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Once the transaction completes, your wallet app will show the OBJKT as transferred to the burn address. The History tab will show a Burn transaction (and the fact that it is a transfer from your wallet to the burn wallet).

4. You can also send the OBJKT to a burn address directly from your Tezos wallet. The address is: `tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX`. 

**Note:** _If you burn all of the objkts that were minted, the objkt will disappear from your profile. If someone buys one of your editions, even if you burn the rest of them, the OBJKT won't disappear from your profile_
