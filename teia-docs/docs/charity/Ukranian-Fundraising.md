# Ukraine Fundraiser

In support for our Ukrainian friends, brothers and sisters, [Veqtor](https://twitter.com/Veqtor/status/1497167740146266112?s=20&t=mmvu8KPxybOa0TQXX32nFw) from [Versum](https://twitter.com/versumofficial) in conjunction with [FxHash](https://twitter.com/fx_hash_/status/1497113572085751810?s=20&t=mmvu8KPxybOa0TQXX32nFw) set up a shared donation contract that will redirect tezos to multiple charity orgs (listed below) in support of Ukraine relief, and we want to help support this initiative.

[NFTBiker](https://twitter.com/NFTBiker) set up an overview Page for the Event, where you can see the amount of money raised, the money already sent out to the orgs and the OBJKT that are minted with the collab contract so that profits & royalties are redirected to the donation smart contract:

He also built a page that lists OBJKTs by Ukranian Artists:
https://nftbiker.xyz/event/ukraine


If you wish to donate, send tezos (no direct NFT donations please, only tezos) or set up a collab contract on [teia.art](https://teia.art/) to direct % of the fees to this fundraiser address (see how to below):

`KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx`

## How to set up a Collaboration Contract on Teia for directing sales to the initiative contract

These are the steps to allocate a percentage of your artwork sales to be sent to the donation contract setup by Versum Team & fxhash in Teia platform

For more information on the collab contract, visit: https://docs.hicathon.xyz/wg-32-sales-improvement-split-sales-and-royalties

Addendum: You donâ€™t need to add the Ukraine Contract `KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx` as a collaborator, instead, add it only as a beneficiary. 



First click on the menu button & click on the **collaborate** option:

<img width='700px' src="img/ukraine_fundraiser/step_01.png" />



Click on _create_ tab, to view the **Core Collaborators screen**
<img width="718" alt="collab-step01c" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4126913/155847151-c2b8c8f9-7ad3-4128-a6ee-ceb4fb7a2777.png" />


Enter your wallet id in the field under 'address', and specify your wallet's share of the sale proceeds. 
To send maximum to the donation contract beneficiary (setup in next steps) set shares=1 at this step.


<img width="726" alt="collab-step01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4126913/155847019-4f01a571-fab6-42e8-91ef-f6d359a903b7.png" />

Select _next_ to continue to the Beneficiaries configuration screen

<img width="708" alt="collab-step02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4126913/155847354-95e78ca9-f1b3-4624-947d-828bf41c34ad.png" />

Click _Add address manually_ link, then add the donation contract, **KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx** to the Beneficiaries field, and set shares=10000. 

This will calculate percentage share between collaborators (you) and the beneficiaries (donation contract)

For example, if using a single collaborator with share=1 and single beneficiary with share=10000 as per these instructions, then the percentage split will be calculated as 0.01% to you and 99.99% of the funds to the donation contract. 
You can enter other values for shares as needed if you want to split proceeds differently to this breakdown

Select _next_ to continue. A summary of your configuration will be shown

Confirm your configuration is correct (check addresses and shares configured in previous steps), then select _create collaborative contract_ to save your settings and create the new collaborative contract. You will then need to approve the action on your wallet to create the new collaboration

The **Manage collaborations screen** will be shown, with a message stating the contract was created successfully. Wait for the wallet transaction to complete, then refresh the page and the new collaboration contract id will be shown (a new KT* address for your collab)

<img width="760" alt="collab-step7" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4126913/155847566-90dc8b5e-a5ac-4b64-ae50-d22e1343ba3f.png" />

If you haven't named the collaboration contract, it will display a link to the Settings option, where you can setup your profile / assign a _Name_ & _Description_ for this new collab (note, this should be different to your usual Profile, choose a name to represent the collaboration/usage). Use lower case names.

Select Save Profile, to save your settings. This transaction will need to be signed by your wallet id. Wait for this to complete, then refresh the collaborate page (or open Collaborate via menu again), and you should see your new collaboration name

<img width="728" alt="collab-step18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4126913/155848686-45b15d06-748d-45b3-af5c-422737235c87.png" />


Once you're ready to mint and swap your artwork using the new collaboration contract, ensure you are signed in to the collaboration you'd like to mint with (if not already signed in from previous step) ie select the Sign In option associated with your collab

Select your collaboration, to open its page.
