## About the event

**#TezosPride** is an ongoing event to celebrate Pride and to support our 2SLGBTQ+ siblings across the Tezos ecosystem. It was initially set up to celebrate Pride Month 2022 and has been continued as a separate [Teia feed](https://teia.art/feed/tezospride) for queer art.

While the feed is ongoing, the main event will last throughout Pride Month (June) and recur every year!

There is also an ecosystem-wide feed for [Tezospride 2023 on NFTBiker.xyz](https://nftbiker.xyz/event/tezospride23?sort=date). Check out and collect artworks from the [2022 Tezospride event on NFTBiker.xyz](https://nftbiker.xyz/event?name=tezospride). There are still some lovely pieces available!

For questions or assistance, please reach out in #❓help. Let's spend Pride month educating ourselves, celebrating, and amplifying our 2SLGBTQ+ siblings across the Tezos ecosystem!

## How to Participate

We are all part of a big, beautiful ecosystem, so you are encouraged to mint on any marketplace! Remember, if you mint on Teia, don't forget to #SwapOnTeia! Make sure you are using the tag "tezospride" while minting and using the hashtag #TezosPride to share your work on Twitter!

There is no limit on the number of pieces or the number of platforms you participate on – that is up to you! The theme for this event is "Pride and Community Support," and how you interpret that is up to you.
