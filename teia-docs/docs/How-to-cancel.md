### **Cancel**

1. _(verb)_ to take your NFT off the market

***

While your objkts are swapped, you can't do anything with them (except watch them get collected). In order to burn, reprice or transfer objkts, they must be in your control, which means unswapped.

To take your OBJKT off the marketplace and no longer for purchase:

1. Make sure your wallet is synced.
2. Load the page for your OBJKT.

3. Click on "listings" and then "cancel". This will send the OBJKTs from the escrow wallet back to your wallet. This will take around 30 seconds to two minutes. The user interface will show you messages to help you know if things went well. Check your wallet for confirmation.

Note that reloading the page will be necessary to show changes. The updated Listings tab will show you how many you now own. This is the maximum number you can reswap, transfer, or burn.

4. Now that they are back in your wallet, you can "swap" them again or burn them.

If you want to delete your OBJKT, continue to [How to burn ðŸ”¥](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/How-to-burn-ðŸ”¥).

**Important:** _If you try to "swap" OBJKTs that are currently for sale, your wallet will throw a warning saying that you have `insufficient funds`. This is because you already sent your OBJKTs to the escrow wallet in the first swap. You need to "cancel" to get the OBJKTs back in your wallet, and then you can "swap" them again._
