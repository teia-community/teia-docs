In Nov 2021 a community of Tezos users banded together aiming to create an open source and inclusive NFT community platform, continuing Hic et nunc's legacy. Teia was born. We thought it was time to introduce you to Teia. The Core Team is a group of very active Teia comtributors from all over the world, who keep Teias Operations running and have executive power over Teia (via multisig votes) until the DAO Token voting contracts are ready and tested.


## About the Core Team Multisig

In the current phase of the DAO, this musltisig has the legal responsibility and ownershi√ºp over Teia DAO LLC until the tokens are diustributed and the DAO contracts have been tested.

This Multisig is also the admin of the Teia marketplace smart contract and Treasury wallet.

this multisig has its dedicated UI. Members use it to vote with the multisig and anyone can check the votes and members on it:
