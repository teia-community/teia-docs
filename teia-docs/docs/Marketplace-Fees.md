## The details: marketplace fees

In the future Swaps that carry value will be charged a fee which goes towards platform maintenance and web3 developments. The fee is paid by the buyer and deducted from the list price. You should factor this in when setting your prices. Free OBJKTs do not incur a maintenance fee.

For example, when fees are set to 2.5% and the price of an OBJKT is 10 tez, and royalties are 10%, then at the point of the swap, 0.25 tez is paid to the platform in fees, 1 tez is paid to the creator in royalties, and 8.75 tez is paid to the seller of the OBJKT.




The fees are calculated automatically by the [Teia Community Marketplace](https://tzkt.io/KT1PHubm9HtyQEJ4BBpMTVomq6mhbfNZ9z5w/operations/) smart contract ([read the source code](https://github.com/teia-community/objkt-swap/blob/master/smart-py/marketplace.py)) and paid out to the [Teia Community multisig](https://tzkt.io/KT1PKBTVmdxfgkFvSeNUQacYiEFsPBw16B4P/operations/) wallet.
