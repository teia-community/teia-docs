Welcome to the [teia.art](https://teia.art/) wiki!

The Teia [DAO](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Governance-on-Teia) is a community powered art platform on the Tezos Blockchain.

It started as a fork of [Hic et Nunc/H=N](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) that aims to continue the spirit of H=N in a decentralised way and with sustainability, accessibility and equity in mind. 

Teia is an artwork made of artworks; A place where artists and collectors come together as equals in order to emancipate and democratize 
art. We want to elevate art, no matter how known or unknown the artist. Everyone on earth should be able to have access to Teia.
We want to protect our art. We
want to fill the blank canvas that is Teia.

Teia is and always will be a work-in-progress, built and improved by its participants. We believe that we as a collective can be bigger than 
the sum of our members.

## Tezos

Teia is built on the Tezos blockchain, a pioneering layer 1 Proof-of-Stake 
blockchain, which is recognized as an energy-efficient alternative to more traditional Proof 
of Work blockchains.

> The total annual carbon footprint of the Tezos blockchain is equivalent to the average energy footprint of 17 global citizens.
