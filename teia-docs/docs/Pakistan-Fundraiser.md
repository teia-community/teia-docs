## The Pakistani Flood Catastrophe

In late August, torrential monsoon triggered the biggest climate related disasters in history: [a third of Pakistans landmass is submerged in water](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/09/Pakistan_inundated) affecting tens of millions of people, washing away houses, destroying crops, hospitals, schools. To date, more than 1,500 people have lost their lives to the floods, including 552 children. Currently, 73% of the flood victims have inadequate access to necessities like food, water, medical aid, etc. 

Now that the water is slowly receding, the full damage is being revealed: not only did the catastrophe displace about 50 million people, destroying essential infrastructure and crops, it also kicked off a health crisis in pakistan: UNICEF confirmed 588 malaria cases with another 10,604 suspected cases, in addition to the 17,977 diarrhoea and 20,064 skin disease cases reported on 15th September.

UN Secretary General António Guterres has demanded the world to[ stop 'sleepwalking toward' planetary 'destruction'.](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sgsm21429.doc.htm) This is another climate related calamity that has hit a country that has only a minimal carbon footprint (less than 1% of the world's carbon emission).

## #savepakistan - Tezos Art Fundraiser for Pakistan

In moments of hardship as this the #cleanNFT community can come together, creating and donating art to raise vital support for those affected. 

While the event faded quickly from the global attention, the Teia community has been looking for ways to partner with new charity organisations, who have trusted connections and valuable outreach in areas facing deeply problematic conditions and is teaming up with [SavePakistanCrypto](https://savepakistan.org/), a Crypto Fund for Pakistan Flood Relief, which is collecting crypto donations in various currencies, offramps it and distributes it to numerous organisations that work on the grund in pakistan trying to provide the needed help and [Tayaba](https://tayaba.org/about-us/), an Organisation that has been actively helping with providing relief for the fresh water scarcity in Pakistan since 2016.

To get to know the two organisations of the fundraiser better, Teia community member [Ruralidyll](https://twitter.com/ruralidyll) (virtually) sat down for an interview with with **Nida Sheikh**, CEO of Tayaba Organisation and **Bilal Bin Saqib**, Co-Founder of SavePakistan and Tayaba . 
They talked about the situation on the ground in pakistan and how Tayaba/SavePakistan plans to use the donations and the grassroots approach they are talking with their Orgs. **[Read the Interview on our blog](https://blog.teia.art/blog/savepakistan-announcement#interview)**

## How to contribute

**The address for this fundraiser initiative is [KT1Jpf2TAcZS7QfBraQMBeCxjFhH6kAdDL4z](https://tzkt.io/KT1Jpf2TAcZS7QfBraQMBeCxjFhH6kAdDL4z/operations/)**

Starting now, use this address to **set up split contracts/swaps on any tezos marketplace** (i.e. Teia, Versum, FxHash, ObjktCom) or **donate tezos or oxtz directly** to the address. (Please don't send NFTs to this address)

Find step-by step guides on how to set splits towards the donation address with [Teia (collab contract with donation address as beneficiary)](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Pakistan-Fundraiser#how-to-set-up-a-split-contract-for-the-fundraiser) and [Objktcom (split swaps)](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Pakistan-Fundraiser#how-to-set-up-a-split-swap-towards-the-cause-on-objktcom) on our wiki.

The main hase of the funraiser will start after the #henreunion event has ended on oct 2nd

Raising awareness for Pakistans situation will be key for this initiative; Let's use the event hashtag **#savepakistan** for minting fundraiser pieces and for twitter posts that relate to the event to concentrate attention on the fundraiser. 

Teia has a **dedicated feed** on the main page for pieces that have a split of at least 50% of the revenue towards the donation address.

There is an [event page on Teztok/Teia.rocks](https://savepakistan.teia.rocks/) that shows a live feed of all pieces minted with the hastag #savepakistan across all tezos marketplaces.

coming up:
* ObjktCom will curate and highlight fundraiser pieces on their front page
* A dedicated curation spot for savepakistan pieces on the community curation twitter [@TeiaArt](https://twitter.com/TeiaArt)
* Versum and FxHash will add the donation address to the list of suggested split addresses.
* ... and there are many more collaborations in the making to highlight art that contributes to the initiative so stay tuned!

If you have ideas or want to help facilitate this fundraiser i.e. by hosting twitter spaces for the event, please head to our discord server (channel: #general-pr-comms) and let us know.

As the natural cycle of news has filtered Pakistan from our thoughts, the situation isn’t going away and likely to only get worse. 
For this reason the contract will remain open and rolling to donations. We are in contact with more marketplaces and will try to keep this fundraiser initiative growing with more marketplaces and events social media channels joining to highlight it. 

You can find more detailed info i.e. about impact and transparency in the article ["Pakistan Fundraiser"](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Pakistan-Fundraiser) on the Teia Wiki.

## Which Organisations get supported and how?

Savepakistan will provide detailed reports about the distribution of funds, as well as reports from the orgs that have been reeiving donations from the fund and their impact on the ground. We will also keep updating infos about the addresses and contracts used for this initiative as well as the admins in control of these addresses. Teias charity team will also keep monitoring Savepakistans actions and check reports and share info directly with the community to ensure transparency.

You can see the current state of the fundraisers coordination in the [Charity Teams working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDuoTy7xgC5Ws1vw_7Qqg7jHrGB6Q_UteFBSBqtdMmE/edit?usp=sharing)

SavePakistan sent us the [working doc "SavePakistan disbursement of funds"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X70hqCXeu98Um7scPxKXVZ8KiLYDs8lYn_VFNwTqhPs/edit?usp=sharing) which contains detailed info on the projects distribution setups, donation targets and further transparency information.

_following info provided by Nida Sheikh, CEO, Tayaba Organisation:_

Accessing marginalized communities in Pakistan is a challenge already, more so now because these communities have become victims of the flood catastrophe.  Fortunately, Tayaba Organisation has an extensive presence through suppliers/vendors in non-affected areas, grassroots level organizations and field teams, and district level authorities, ensuring maximum contribution to providing relief to flood victims. Apart from being connected with key stakeholders within government and state institutions, a few of Tayabaorg’s major grassroots level partners that currently have deep penetration and access to marginalised/flood-affected areas:


#### Grassroots Level Presence 

In partnership with grassroots level organisations and government/state authorities, adopting a systems approach, Tayaba maps or identifies areas and communities through rapid needs assessment surveys. 

Any donation/distribution of relief goods like the H2O Wheels is preceded by a robust needs assessment process for affected and impoverished communities. Each case submitted by our Implementing Partner is reviewed by our team and verified through a third party (e.g., district officials or spot-check ) assessment. After due diligence and approvals, relief goods are disseminated to deserving people, complemented by community sensitization and awareness sessions.

We have successfully provided,
 
🕊 10 Portable Toilets: Eco-friendly portable toilets that ensure sustainable sanitation and provide a hygienic drainage system through a PVC pipe and a proper water closet system, thereby not contributing to stagnant waters or contaminating the nearby water sources. It is highly time and cost-efficient, as it gets functional within 5-7 days and serves up to 60 people.

🕊 70 H2O Wheels: A 40-litre clean and safe water transporter and storage container.

## The donation contract


**The address for this fundraiser initiative is [T1Jpf2TAcZS7QfBraQMBeCxjFhH6kAdDL4z](https://tzkt.io/KT1Jpf2TAcZS7QfBraQMBeCxjFhH6kAdDL4z/operations/)**


The [code of this contract can be found on github](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-smart-contracts/blob/main/python/contracts/donations.py)

The contract is in place to have one layer of control between the tezos art initiative and the addresses we want to donate to it is controlled by a multisig of multiple people involved in the tezos NFt ecosystem. The contract also allows its admins to later add more tezos addresses if we find more trustworthy Pakistani orgs that accept tezos donations. [The details on who is in control of the contract setup can be found on this wiki article](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Teia-Multisig-wallets#cross-marketplace-charity-contract-and-multisig).

Currently we only have one address to send donations to which is the tezos address of savepakistan ([tz1dioG5h9YWm521ph4Q454dH5J7hLzg6n4A](http://tz1diog5h9ywm521ph4q454dh5j7hlzg6n4a/)) from where it will be off ramped to fiat currency and distributed between the Organisations in Tayabas/Savepakistans fund (find more info on the fundraiser initiative in [the Interview with the Orgs on our blog](https://blog.teia.art/blog/savepakistan-announcement#interview) or [above](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Pakistan-Fundraiser#which-organisations-get-supported-and-how)




## how to set up a split contract for the fundraiser

First, sync your wallet (1), go to the menue and select "collaborate" (2)

![Re01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135804-84f8dda2-0939-4651-8958-938afbe84262.JPG)

Then go to the "create" tab (3), add your wallet address to "Addresses (4) and give your address shares for the split (this will determine how much shares of the sales revenue will be distributed to your wallet, more on this later. Then, hit "next" (6)

![re02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135808-190bb996-5ab9-4f2a-a500-eb631953bd15.jpg)

Under "Beneficiaries" select a suggested address/cause (in our case its Pakistan Relief, but you can add other addresses manually or from that list if you want to) (7)

![re03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135811-741e5d7a-d539-4677-b9db-7675126a8259.jpg)

You have to give the Beneficiary address shares too (8): The ratio between the shares will be used to calculate the percentage split of revenues between the addresses you listed. This applies to both primary and secondary sales and can't be changed after the contract has been created. Note that in order to appear on Teias dedicated feed for the initiative, you need to at least donate 50% of the splits towards the donation address.

Next, hit ... well ... "next" (9)

![re04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135817-def09304-531a-4b52-9905-ccda1ea12396.jpg)

Click on "create collaborative contract" - confirm the transaction with your wallet and wait a few moments. 
Congratulations, you got your collab contract!

![re05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135819-75afaf1b-d953-4da1-ad91-34ddcac531fa.jpg)

To mint you need to "log in" to your new contract, you can do that in the "manage" tab of the "collaborate" menue point (11+12)

![re06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135821-02e0cc31-49ad-4800-83c4-bb4edbd8703a.JPG)

![re07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135824-57534ecb-8dc4-440d-a575-cdbb83163890.JPG)

Now you should see the collab contract address in the top right corner and can now mint like you would do normally.
Pro tip: As long as you are logged into your collab contract, you can also give it a profile name on teia in the "settings" option of the menue.

![re08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/193135829-89bfe248-82ae-4116-9d34-c5ca32f08be8.JPG)

To make the collab piece appear in your "collab" tab on your teia profile, you have to sign the collab. you can do that on the objkt page of your piece minted with the contract directly under the image: "sign your contract now"

Congratulations, you are done!

# how to set up a split swap towards the cause on objktcom

if you want to use objktcom to dedicate a % of your swap towards the charity address, you can set up a split swap:

of course you need to be logged into the acc you want to swap from, then head over to the page of the token and to the "action" tab (1) and hit "advanced sale" (2)

![ob01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/194743600-a4ee2aa3-fde7-4890-a70e-7ad78fea8cd7.JPG)

like with any other swap, fill out the number of editions you want to swap and at which priche (3) and hit the "+" to add more beneficiaries to the swap

![ob02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/194743602-e333e413-7416-4fe0-9ce2-e8c7c211a466.JPG)

put in the donation address (5) (in the case of savepakistan it's KT1Jpf2TAcZS7QfBraQMBeCxjFhH6kAdDL4z), set the splits in % (in the case of this example 10% will go towards the creators address and 90 % will go towards the donation address.

finally hit "list token" (7), approve the transaction in your wallet and you are done!

![ob03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97635650/194743605-95494195-93dd-4593-b9ac-648f6bfbfb20.JPG)
