First, you will need a Tezos wallet and Tezos funds.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [on the Wikipedia Article about Tezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos).

## What wallets do you recommend?
Some wallets compatible with our dApp are:
* [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/) which is a browser extension similar to Metamask, also being able to connect to Ledger devices.
* [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/), which is a browser wallet, being possible to connect making use of Direct Auth using Twitter credentials.  Kukai also works on smartphones.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on Teia only costs ~0.05 tezos. You can buy some tezos on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken. However, the exchange service might be limited depending on your country and location.

## Common wallet errors

_account doesn't exist error from tzkt.io_

 If your account on tzkt.io shows this, don't worry. It just means you don't have any transactions yet in your wallet. Once you receive some tezos it should go away.

_Prevalidation error in the temple wallet_

This means you should refresh the page. Wait a couple of seconds for the transaction to go through and you will get the "applied" status.
