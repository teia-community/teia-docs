# Contributing

This GitHub wiki is a **drafting space** for Teia documentation.  
You are welcome to use it to quickly sketch out ideas, guides, or reference material.

However, **finished Teia documentation is published at**:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://docs.teia.art](https://docs.teia.art)

Please keep in mind:

- Use this wiki only for **drafting docs** and for **guidance on how to use this repository**.  
- Once a draft is ready to be shared more widely, it should be moved into the Docusarus site under `//teia-docs/docs/` and submitted via a Pull Request.  
- The Teia Docs repository (`teia-docs`) exists to maintain and publish documentation for the Teia community.

For more details on updating the published docs, see:
