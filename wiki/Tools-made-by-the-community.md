Due to the open source nature of Teia/hicetnunc, a lot of tools have been built around the Tezos NFT ecosystem. Here we try to compile a list of community built tools especially around the OBJKT Token standard. Please note that most of these tools are experimental and some might not be maintained or use outdated data. Please move defunct tools to the deprecated section at the end of this document. Found a new tool? Please add it to the list.

## Info for tool builders

Did you develop a tool and want it listed here? Please file an [issue in this repo](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/issues) and it will be checked and added.

If your tool relies on older Indexer instances like hicdex.com the new Teia swaps will probably not be available in your tool. You can read more about the [Indexer changes for the Teia swaps](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Indexer-changes-for-Teia) and how to make your tools work with teia swaps. Of course, feel free to come to the Teia Discord server to ask questions around tool building and indexing.
