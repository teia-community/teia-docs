## NFT Creators' Code of Ethics	

This code is intended as a framework of ethics for creators to foster a healthy long term relationship and trust with collectors.
It is not intended to be enforced by anyone or to be used in any binding capacity.


* I will not mint anyone elseâ€™s work without their prior knowledge and agreement

* If a work is the result of a cooperation I will give credit where credit is due

* I will not mint the same work on different chains or platforms unless explicitly stated beforehand

* I will not re-mint any of my work unless it is in a transformative way
	
* If an NFT is part of a series of similar works I will declare this from the first minted work

* I will not mint any work that infringes on the personal rights of other individuals (Parody and satire are not regarded as an infringement of personal rights.)

* If possible I will contact the author of a work that I wish to create a derivative work of

* I will not try to misrepresent the identity of the author of the work or the identity of the work that I mint

* I may sell physical editions with the same content as my NFTs unless I specifically tie a physical edition to a tokenized one and vice versa

* I will be transparent about any future potential technical issues with the preservation and longevity of my NFT to the best of my knowledge.
