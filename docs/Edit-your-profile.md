## Settings > Config

To edit your profile use the **Settings** option in the menu or go to: https://www.teia.art/config

**IMPORTANT** _When configuring your username, please don't use any special characters or spaces for the username. Its also case-sensitive, so we recommend ALL LOWERCASE_

## Tezos Profiles (optional)
Tezos Profiles (https://tzprofiles.com/) is a web application where users can associate their public online identity based on social media profiles and self-attested information to their Tezos address. This is an extra layer of verification and it's not required to complete your profile information, it will only add icons confirming you control your twitter account and wallet address.

**IMPORTANT:** _Tezos Profiles transaction costs 0.3 tez, so avoid doing this if you are a fountain reciever (you only have 0.5 tez) or are low on funds_

If tzprofiles seems too complicated, you can type your social media handles on your profile description and your profile link (teia.art/yourusername) on your social media. This is a simple way to validate your identity

## Creating a Tezos Profile

- To create a Tezos Profile, visit the [Tezos Profiles](https://tzprofiles.com/) dapp.
- Connect your wallet (on mainnet). You will now be presented with available verifications that you can add to your Tezos Profile.

- Click on the 'Verify' link next to the verification you would like to add.

**In order to obtain a Twitter verification:**
- First enter your Twitter handle. Note: this is just your username alone, like "tezosprofiles."

- Next, sign a message using your wallet that links your Twitter handle to your Tezos account.
- After that, you will be prompted to Tweet out that same message, along with a signature to link the Tweet to what you just signed using your wallet. Note: the Tweet must include the entire message, including the signature. Pressing the "Tweet" button will pre-fill the Tweet for you.
- Finally, copy the direct link to the Tweet you just sent out by hitting the "share" button, and selecting "Copy Link to Tweet." Use this URL in the final step.

- If the signature in the Tweet matches what you signed with your wallet, the verification should be complete.

**Deploying your Tezos Profile**
- Back on the main list of available verifications, your Twitter verification should now have the "Awaiting Upload" status.
- Obtain any additional verifications you would like to add, and hit the "Deploy Profile" button above in order to start the process of launching your Tezos Profile. Note: if you have already launched a Tezos Profile and are adding additional verifications, this button will say "Upload Claims."

- You will now go through the process of deploying your Tezos Profile which consists of signing operations (no-cost, uploading your credentials) and deploying your Tezos Profiles smart contract.
- After this is complete, your Tezos Profile is now available and can be used by applications and services like Teia!

You can ask for help troubleshooting this process in the verification channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nSGGhxKa).
