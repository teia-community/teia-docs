## **About Copyminting**

Copyminting is the act of taking another's work and minting it as your own. We come down heavily on any account that does this. It results in an instant restriction. Several processes are in place to detect copyminting and other behaviors against the CoC. A copymint team also oversees the processes and acts as moderators over accounts in question.

## **Restricted accounts**
Accounts that TEIA restricts are labeled “restricted account,” and OBJKTs that a restricted account has minted are labeled “restricted OBJKT” in the marketplace.

Teia currently shares the list of banned/restricted accounts with hicetnunc.xyz - currently the list is managed on hicetnuncs discord server. Teia is working on setting up its own copymint report channel. for now please use the #report-copyminters channel on [the hicetnunc discord server](https://discord.gg/rJeAgCUPZR) for reports or for unban requests

Various other Tezos marketplaces also use the Hicetnunc/Teia restricted list of accounts, which means that once TEIA restricts an account, other NFT marketplaces will likely follow suit.

It is important to note that we do not tolerate harassment of any kind and using the site to harass others can result in restrictions in your teia/hicetnunc profile and your Discord account.

### Procedure if your account has been restricted

The copymint report channel on the Teia community discord server will be set up soon, for now copymint reports should be directed to the #report-copyminters channel of the [original "hicetnunc" Discord server](https://discord.gg/4CR2X7mh)). 

You should not expect a warm reception if you attempt malicious action on the platform or threaten mods and admin. The team has to process many requests, some of which are less than honest.

Unfortunately, they have to begin the process with a lack of trust, and you have to convince them that you are trustworthy. The most straightforward way to overturn a mistaken restriction is to engage with the team politely.

Provide your account address and the reason for the dispute. Be prepared to show works in progress or versions of a work in question so the team can verify and determine if the restriction is mistaken. Having a well-used Twitter account, work is shown on your website, Instagram, Flickr, Tumblr, etc., that is your own will help.

If the copymint team agrees that the account does not violate the CoC, the account affected will be removed from the restricted list. It takes about 5 mins for any changes to the restricted list to go live.

## excerpt from the current [Code of Conduct/Terms and conditions](https://teia.art/terms)

The copymint team operates on the following Terms and work voluntarily to keep TEIA free of copymints and keep collectors and artists happy. Please understand their role and that processes like this do generate mistakes. The team investigates when alerted through the #report-copyminters channel of the [original "hicetnunc" Discord server](https://discord.gg/4CR2X7mh)). Please respect their work, and help them by being courteous and accurate with the information that will help your inquiry.

It’s important to notice that errors are possible at this stage, and we apologize for such cases. We ask users to direct such issues exclusively through the channel.

Since TEIA is a decentralized application, restricted OBJKTs are only superficially restricted, meaning that they are still available through APIs and on-chain data.
Reasons for an account restriction:
- Copymint: minting another artist(s) work without their consent or minting your identical work more than once. Copyminting can also include OBJKTs based on another artist's work, with minimal filters or modifications applied.
- Duplicate mints across marketplaces: if you mint the same work more than once without artistic merit or an apparent reference for prospective buyers.
- Infringed copyright: the use of artists' work in part or whole where the artist explicitly forbids third party use.
- Funding from a confirmed restricted account.
- Funding of confirmed restricted accounts.
- Wash trading: market manipulation through buying own OBJKTs directly or indirectly.
- Minting material that glorifies human rights violations or is soley pornographic without any artistic expression. This applies especially but is not limited to cases of copied or filtered pornographic content stolen from third parties.
- Violates the CoC in other ways: mainly if it is overtly abusive to another group, invokes violence, or intimidates or harasses.
