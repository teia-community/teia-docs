○ hDAO is a media governance token. They are distributed through NFTs, composing a curated feed. NFTs, tags, galleries are intended to be organized based on hDAO balances. It's purpose is to create a circular economy.

## How do I earn hDAO?
From Hicetnunc's launch (March 1) to mid-April, when you bought an NFT, say for 1ꜩ, you earned 0.5 hDAO, and the seller would also earn 0.5 hDAO. Now that distribution is over, you can only buy hDAO. Continue reading for how to buy hDAO.

## Can I convert my hDAO to another token, or use them for anything else?
You can currently swap hDAO to Tezos and other coins at [Quipuswap](https://quipuswap.com/swap?from=tez&to=KT1AFA2mwNUMNd4SsujE1YYp29vd8BZejyKW_0) or , automated market-making decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Tezos blockchain. You can also earn a share of trading fees by [adding your hDAO to the liquidity pools](https://xtz.news/defi-news/quipuswap/decentralized-exchange-quipuswap-is-live-on-tezos/), although this comes with an element of risk.

## I have some useful feedback for how to make this feature better. How can I add my input?
Here's the original [proposal](https://hicetnunc2000.medium.com/hicetnunc-microfunding-protocol-e270a63eb73c) and [discussion](https://community.hicetnunc.xyz/t/hdao-curation-discovery/20) for hDAO. hDAO is also mentioned in the original [manifesto](https://hicetnunc2000.medium.com/objkt-swap-62dbaf776336)

## how to change hDAO curation amount
Under your account [configuration](https://teia.art/config) it's possible to determine how much hDAO is going to be used while curating as `advanced settings` where `1000000 μhDAO = 1 hDAO`. When you click save, the value is stored in your local session storage. This should not trigger a wallet transaction.
