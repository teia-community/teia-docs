## Can I sell my OBJKTs on Opensea?
Opensea announced in February 2021 that they will be working with Tezos. They haven't announced any news since then. We can only hope this will be an option in the future.

## Why is my OBJKT not showing up on the latest feed?
You need to have registered/updated a profile and/or hold some hDAO tokens to be shown on feed. How much hDAO you need is relative to how much you mint and current market price. If you have an update profile you may mint ~7 OBJKTs per week-window, beyond that you will need the minimum of (0.5tez, $1 or 0.1hDAO), in hDAO, per OBJKT, beyond your 7 free ones, furthmore, if you mint a lot in a 3 hour span, that threshold is fed through a exponential within that 3 hour window.
You may acquire hDAO through tips (withdrawal coming soon!) or by purchasing it via swap markets like [Quipuswap](https://quipuswap.com/swap).
This was implemented to combat copyminters and shouldn't affect regular users.

## How to avoid copyminters
Unfortunately, there are people minting NFTs who did not create what they upload. These copyminters, as we call them, try to make a quick buck with art from other people. Collectors have to very careful and try to find out who the artists are and if the art is genuine.

To make it easier for buyers, please leave a trace to any social profile or website in the description of your artwork, so potential buyers can validate the authenticity. If you can link the NFTs the artist is advertising on the profile with the NFTs on Hicetnunc, you can assume it is legit.

## I want to report a copyminter
The fastest way to report a copyminter in [hicetnuncs discord](https://discord.gg/Yx6UN5SkCd) in the #report-copyminters channel.

## How can I promote my NFT or my NFT exhibition?

## Do you support multiple languages?
We are working on multiple language support on Teia. we also try to translate as many documents as possible to keep everything accessible. But currently teia.art is only available in english.
