How to place your OBJKT on the secondary market.

***


1. Make sure your wallet is synced.
2. Head over to your [Collections] and click on the OBJKT.
3. Click on the [collectors] tab to see all of the owners and sellers.
4. Click on [swap] and set a price for your OBJKT.

_IMPORTANT: Once swapping something up for sale, it is sent to the Teia escrow wallet while it is "on the market". Therefore, the OBJKT will disappear from your collections. Don't worry, its still up for sale!_
