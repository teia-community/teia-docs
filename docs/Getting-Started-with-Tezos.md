First you will need Tezos and a Tezos wallet.

## What is Tezos?
Tezos (XTZ) is a liquid proof-of-stake cryptocurrency (LPoS). You can read more about it [on the Wikipedia Article about Tezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos)

## What wallets do you recommend?
Some wallets compatible to our dApp are [Temple wallet](https://templewallet.com/) which is a browser extension similar to Metamask, also being able to connect to Ledger devices. [Kukai wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/), which is a browser wallet, being possible to connect making use of Direct Auth using twitter credentials.  Kukai also works on smartphones.

## Where to buy tezos
Minting on Teia only costs ~0.05 tezos. You can buy some on an exchange site like Binance or Kraken, however we recommend consulting with someone who is from whichever country you are in because exchange services are provided depending on the country.

**Common wallet errors**
![account doesnt exist error from tzkt.io](https://imgshare.io/images/2021/05/15/account_doesnt_exist.png)

_Pro tip: If your account on tzkt.io shows this, don't worry. It just means you don't have any transactions yet in your wallet. Once you receive some tezos it should go away._

![Prevalidation error in the temple wallet](https://imgshare.io/images/2021/05/15/pre_validation_error.png)

_Pro tip: This means you should refresh the page. Just give it a couple of seconds for the transaction to go through and you will get the "applied" status._
