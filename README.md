# Teia Documentation

## Docs Site

The official Teia documentation is moving to [docs.teia.art](https://docs.teia.art), built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed to GitHub Pages from this repo.

This is the primary source for documentation going forward. 

The migration is tracked in [issue #21](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/issues/21).

## Teia Wiki

The [Teia Wiki](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki) is a staging area for drafts and early notes.  
It is not the final home for documentation. Use it to outline ideas or propose edits before they move to the docs site.  

- Members of the [Teia-Community](https://github.com/teia-community) GitHub organization can edit directly in the wiki.  
- The wiki content is also stored in the [`//wiki`](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/tree/main/wiki) folder of this repository. Edits there can be made through pull requests if you want review.  
- Changes in the `//wiki` folder and the GitHub wiki associated with this repo stay in sync via GitHub actions.

## Contributing

Ways to help with documentation:  

- Open pull requests with improvements.  
- Review and discuss PRs and issues.  
- Contribute translations where possible.  

The goal is to provide clear, accurate documentation for the Teia community.
