# Teia Documentation

Welcome to the official Teia documentation repository. This repo hosts both the **Teia Docs Site** — published at [docs.teia.art](https://docs.teia.art) — and the **Teia Wiki** for early drafts and notes.

## ✍️ Teia Docs Site

The official Teia documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed to GitHub Pages from the [`teia-docs/`](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/tree/main/teia-docs) folder in this repository.

As decided in [poll #46](https://teia.art/poll/46), the GitHub Pages site is now configured to use the **teia.art** domain.

## Repository Structure

- `DocumentArchive` — Historical and reference documents preserved for archival purposes (not actively maintained).
- `teia-docs/` — Source for the Docusaurus-powered documentation site.  
- `wiki/` — Mirror of the GitHub Wiki for drafts and early notes.  
- `.github/workflows/` — Actions to sync wiki content and deploy the docs site.

## 📚 Teia Wiki

The [Teia Wiki](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki) serves as a **staging area** for documentation drafts and early notes.  
It is not the final home for documentation — use it to outline ideas or propose edits before they move to the main docs site.

- Members of the [Teia Community](https://github.com/teia-community) GitHub organization can edit the wiki directly.  
- The wiki content is mirrored in the [`wiki/`](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/tree/main/wiki) folder, so edits can also be made via pull requests if review is desired.  
- A GitHub Action keeps the `wiki/` folder and the GitHub Wiki in sync automatically.
