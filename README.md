**Teia Wiki &amp; Documentation**

## [Teia Wiki](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki)

You can edit the [wiki](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki) if you are a member of the Teia-Community organization
using the GitHub wiki interface or by editing the files in the [/wiki](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/tree/main/wiki) directory
of this repo.  Optionally, when you edit the files in the /wiki directory, you
can create a PR and collaborate with others to review the change.

Updates to files in the /wiki folder will be published to the wiki and updates
in the wiki itself will sync changes back to the /wiki folder.

## Docusaurus Trial

We are also trialing a new documentation workflow using **Docusaurus**. [A proof-of-concept site](https://teia-community.github.io/teia-docs/) is already available, and [an open issue](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/issues/21) is tracking the tasks needed to complete the migration. As part of this process, the wiki will be “reset” and used primarily as a staging area — a place to draft, revise, and collaborate on documents before they are published on the docs site.  

You can still draft content however you prefer (some contributors use Google Docs, for example), but the wiki remains a convenient option for quick collaboration. Please note that it should not be treated as the final home for documentation, only as a workspace before publishing.
